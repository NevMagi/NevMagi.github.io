Bin is a true superstar of the lab! He was my first office mate when I first came to Leipzig at the end of my Master's. He regularly brought random dragofruit or even whole lunches. Also, some of the most memorable moments in the lab were when Bin used some of his trademark unique humor. 

Bin is pimarily interested in understanding how brain strcuture contributes to the manifestation of mental health. Within our lab, he has primarily focused on brain asymmetry, a topic he approached from (among others) the perspectives of evolution (cross-species comparisons) and disorder (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Bin has also done several research stays abroad, and is always looking for new collaborations!
