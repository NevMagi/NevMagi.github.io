Hi, my name is Neville Magielse and I am currently a third-year PhD student in the group of Dr. Sofie Valk. I am broadly interested in neuroscience, love doing data visualisation, writing, and generally fond of telling stories. I always aim to have an outgoing, eager, and connecting attitude, making the most out of any project I am involved in.

My scientific work is primarily focused on characterizing cerebellar structure and function, and unifying multimodal, system-level perspectives into a common framework. So far in my PhD, I have worked on three main cerebellar projects (find them in the [projects](https://nevmagi.github.io/projects/) page): one on primate evolution, one on human development, and one on large-scale meta-analytic mapping.

There are a lot of other things I find interesting as well (apart from random informational youtube videos). A primary interest includes improving medical education, supporting both the physician and medical scientist of tomorrow. An example project is when I helped in designing and implementating a graduate course called eXperience & eXpertise. This course was specifically designed to make the most of biomedical students with the unique double roll of also having a chronic condition (see [projects](https://nevmagi.github.io/projects/)). Generally, I have always enjoyed student representation and governance in the medical sector, and hope to combine my passions of brain science, medical governance, and also teaching in the future.

Besides my professional interests, I try to maintain an active social live, spending at least half a day each week in a coffee bar. Most of my other spare time is taken up by a hobby-turned-obsession: running. Find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/51535523) for the latest!
