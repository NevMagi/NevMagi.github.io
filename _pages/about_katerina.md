Katerina is my cerebellum-buddy in the lab. Apart from that, we are likely the primary enjoyers of memes in our team. She also works as part of the lab of Charlotte Grosse Wiesmann. Her primary researrch focus is characterising the development of the human cerebellum. She has previously studied the onset of Theory of Mind-related activity in the cerebellum during movie-watching fMRI paradigms desgined specifically to gauge the development of functional networks in the very young. She has now also started on a projrect relating these data to the cerebellar structure.

We are currently working together on two projects: one describing normative cerebellar development relative to the cerebral cortex (headed by Katerina) and one constructing a cerebellar functional topography from fMRI data through adapted meta-analysis (headed by me).
